    <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">11. What is mean by adapter  in software design?</div>
    <div class="answer"> In software design, an Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two classes by converting the interface of one class into an interface expected by the client.</div>

    <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">12.what is publish-subscribe in software design ? </div>
    <div class="answer">In software design, Publish-Subscribe (Pub-Sub) is a messaging pattern where publishers send messages without knowing the recipients, and subscribers receive messages based on interest, without knowing the sender. It promotes loose coupling between components. </div>

    <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">13.What is proxy,façade in software design? </div>
    <div class="answer"> In software design:
        •	Proxy is a structural design pattern that provides an object representing another object, controlling access to it. It can be used for lazy initialization, access control, or logging.
        •	Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier to use by hiding the subsystem's complexity.
        </div>

    <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">14..What is UI design </div>
    <div class="answer">UI (User Interface) Design is the process of designing the layout, visual elements, and interactive components of a software application or website.

    <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">15.What is symbolic execution? </div>
    <div class="answer">Symbolic execution is a program analysis technique where a program is executed with symbolic inputs (instead of actual data). The execution explores multiple paths by using symbols to represent values, allowing the analysis of different possible outcomes and detecting potential errors or vulnerabilities without running the program with specific inputs.

    </div>

    <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">16. What is model checking ?</div>
    <div class="answer">Model checking is an automated verification technique used in software engineering and hardware design to check whether a system (typically represented as a model) satisfies certain specifications or properties.

    <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">17. Define :Debugging </div>
    <div class="answer">Debugging is the process of identifying, isolating, and fixing bugs or errors in software. It involves analyzing the code, running tests, and using tools to track down and resolve issues that cause the program to behave incorrectly or unexpectedly. </div>

    <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">18.what is regression testing </div>
    <div class="answer"> Regression testing is the process of testing software after changes (such as enhancements, bug fixes, or updates) to ensure that new code does not negatively impact the existing functionality. It helps verify that previously working features continue to function as expected.</div>

    <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">19.Write the difference between black box and white box testing?</div>
    <div class="answer">Black Box Testing:
        •	Focuses on testing the functionality of the software without knowledge of its internal code or structure.
        •	Testers validate inputs and outputs, ensuring the system meets the specified requirements.
        White Box Testing:
        •	Involves testing the internal structure, logic, and code of the software.
        •	Testers need knowledge of the source code to create test cases, checking conditions like code paths and loops.
         </div>

    <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">20.What is Software project management? </div>
    <div class="answer"> Software Project Management is the process of planning, organizing, and overseeing the development and delivery of software projects.

    <div class="answer"> loud as a Platform refers to using cloud computing services to develop, deploy, and manage applications over the internet. It offers scalable resources, flexibility, and cost efficiency without the need for physical infrastructure. Popular examples include AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, which provide services like computing, storage, and networking to support business needs.</div>

    <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">24.. what are deployment tools? </div>   
    <div class="answer"> Deployment tools are software applications or platforms that automate the process of moving code from development to production environments.
